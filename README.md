## Description
Here is an app to talk about the shitty code you can write.
It is still *A LOT* in progress.
Like...there is still no app, almost.


## Setup
Install `docker`
Run `docker-compose up` in root directory

### Frontend
Go to `http://localhost:3000` to see the frontend app

### Backend
The backend runs on `4000` port

### Database
The databse runs on `28015` port

## Credits
@tokalazy sort of got the idea for this project.
His code is the main source of inspiration.
